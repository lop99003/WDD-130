        <p>My name is Alma Alicia Sanchez. I was born in Houston, Texas, raised in 
            the San Francisco Bay Area and currently live in the Rio Grande 
            Valley of Texas. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter 
            Day Saints and have been brought up in the church. I am sealed and 
            married to my husband and 2 energetic, loving children. I graduated 
            from BYU-I with a bachelors degree in University Studies and a Minor 
            in History. I also graduated from the University of Phoenix Online with 
            a Masters degree in Psychology. Currently I am a 19th year ELAR middle 
            school teacher and love it, but I'm getting tired. I have Multiple 
            Sclerosis, a 24 year survivor, and for that reason I am going back to 
            school to work in a field I can do from home and get paid a lot more 
            money than what I'm making right now. I am looking forward to earning 
            my Bachelors degree in Computer Programming.</p>
